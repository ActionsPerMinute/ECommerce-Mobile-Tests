# ECommerce-Mobile-Tests
Simple mobile clients to test Mobile RUM beacon generation for the [ECommerce](https://github.com/Appdynamics/ECommerce-Docker) application.

These applications use a variety of languages and networking frameworks, with simple "bare-bones" user interfaces. Their primary purpose is to test beacon generation and server request correlation using the AppDynamics Mobile RUM Agents.

For each project, you will need to import the AppDynamics Mobile Agent for the target platform and configure the mobile application for your ECommerce target and EUM Collector/AppKey.  See the project's README file for details.
